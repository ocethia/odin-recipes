    <h2>Spiced Cranberry Orange Cheesecake</h2>
    <p>I set out to create this recipe for a family Christmas party. The idea for the recipe had been bouncing around in my head for a little while, And after a few iterations, I think I've landed on something special.</p>
    <p>The recipe contains a beautifully orange flavored cheesecake, with a little spiced cranberry throughout, and a generous swirl of spiced cranberry sauce on top. Together, the flavors are reminiscent of a nice and warm mulled apple cider on a chilly winter day.</p>

            <li>1/4 cup of the cranberry sauce</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <h4>For the Cranberry Sauce</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Measure and add all ingredients to a small pot</li>
            <li>Bring to the ingredients to a small boil</li>
            <li>Let simmer for about 15 minutes</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and blend together until smooth</li>
            <li>Let cool completely in the fridge</li>
        </ol>
    <h4>For the Crust</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Crush the graham crackers if they aren't already</li>
            <li>Combine the graham crackers, sugar, and butter in a bowl until evenly mixed</li>
            <li>Press in to the bottom of a 9in springform pan</li>
        </ol>
    <h4>For the Orange Cheesecake</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Mixing works best if the cream cheese is brought up to room temperature.</li>
            <li>preheat your oven to 325F</li>
            <li>With a kitchen-aid or hand mixer, combine the cream cheese and sugar</li>
            <li>Doing one or two eggs at a time, add them to the sweetened cream cheese, mixing on the lowest setting until just combined. You may crack the eggs in to a separate bowl before adding to the cream cheese if worried about accidentally adding shells.</li>
            <li>Once all the eggs are added, you want to be careful of overmixing</li>
            <li>Switch to a rubber spatula, and fold in the orange zest</li>
            <li>Fold in some of your cooled cranberry sauce</li>
            <li>Pour mixture in to prepared 9in springform pan over your crust</li>
            <li>Gently tap and wiggle on a flat surface to help remove any bubbles, and using your spatula, flatten the top as best you can if necessary</li>
            <li>Using your preferred method, drizzle cranberry sauce over the top of the cheesecake, and then gently swirl using a chopstick or something similar. Putting the sauce in a ziploc bag, and then cutting a tiny bit off the corner works just fine as a squeeze bottle replacement</li>
            <li>Finally, place the cheesecake in the oven. and let it cook for about 40 to 50 minutes. The edges should look firm, while the center will still be slightly wobbly.</li>
            <li>when it is finished cooking, turn off the oven, leave the oven door cracked open, and let the cheesecake cool slowly</li>
            <li>Move the cheesecake to the fridge, and let cool over night</li>
        </ol>
