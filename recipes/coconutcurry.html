    <h2>Coconut Curry Stir Fry</h2>
        <p>This recipe is one of my favorites. Once you've built up your knife skills, it's quick and easy to prepare and then pull together. And if you're newer to cooking, it's a great place to practice. This is a simple, customizable recipe that is still packed full of flavor.</p>
        <p>In the recipe, I'm going to use chicken thighs for my protein. They're a personal favorite, juicer than breasts, and a lot harder to overcook and dry out. But swapping to a protein like tofu or steak is simple. For tougher meats just remember to slice them thinly. In addition, the recipe is going to use lo mein noodles for a starch. You could easily replace with rice, or any other type of noodle, or completely omit all together.</p>
        <p>Once you understand the basic process of stir frying, it's easy to tweak to your tastes. While I'm going to give amounts for this recipe, I highly recommend you taste as you go and add more or less as you feel. You're making this for you.</p>
